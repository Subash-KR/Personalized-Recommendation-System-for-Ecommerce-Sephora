# Personalized-Recommendation-System-for-Ecommerce-Sephora

The Sephora Personalized Recommendation System is an innovative project aimed at providing tailored product recommendations to Sephora customers. Leveraging the power of data science and machine learning, we've created a system that understands your preferences, considers product similarities, and groups users to offer a unique shopping experience.
